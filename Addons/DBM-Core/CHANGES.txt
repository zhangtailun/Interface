    GUI will now show icons used for EACH icon option right next to the option (in addition to the top of mod still showing all icons used in total by the encounter), when supported by the mod.

    Added a lot of short text names to timer text (especially to uunat) (remember if you prefer full spell names you can turn short text off in timer options)
    Made torment icons off by default since the visual circles are already pretty obvious, option is still there if you wish to re-enable
    Added counts to remaining abilities that were missing them (had forgotten one of nzoth gifts and tank abilities)
    Changed some counts to reset on phase change on uunat, but I'm actually still up in air on that and may make it a user option for counts to persist or reset.
    Added berserk timers form public WCL wipes (at least from normal, unconfirmed how LFR/mythic will look next week. Likely we'll see longer/no berserk on LFR and shorter on on mythic)

    Swap order of Crucible and Zuldazar on mod sort list

    Fixed mod name for Crucible in addon list
    Changed icons used by Restless and uunat again for compat reasons
    Added count to undying guardians on uunat
    Added tracking on infoframe to show how long relics have been on ground after they've been dropped on uunat
    Enabled Umbrel Absorb remaining on infoframe when present on uunat, in addition to announcing it applied/faded
    Removed boss power tracking for real this time, last time I removed it I must not have actually hit save. it's redundant, we have a timer for his special and infoframe needs to focus on stuff timers don't.
    Reverted last timer edit since the information provided by user wasn't actually useful enough to figure out where that 0.9 second difference is, it could have been a phase change timer too.
    Put a limit of 5 icons tops for torment, to ensure it'll never cross over add icons on uunat

    pull debuff remaining directly from debuff on volatile charge instead of hard coding to try and fix issue with countdown text being slow (even though it had right number). if this still doesn't fix problem, then it has to be a problem with scheduler (although I cannot find one and most other countdowns using same scheduler work fine)
